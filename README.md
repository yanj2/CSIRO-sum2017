# CSIRO-sum2017
Projects or code that I worked on at CSIRO during the summer vacation project in 2017-2018

Machine-Learning: 
Functions in get_data.py written with help from "Hands On Machine-Learning with Scikist-learn & Tensorflow" by O'Reilly 

deap - learning and working with the deap framework:
- genetic algorithms: solving black box optimisation problems using genetic algorithms in serial and parallel
- pso: solving black box optimisation problems using particle swarm optimisation algorithm 
- tutorials: learning the functionality of deap framework in python 

machine-learning - gaining background information for interest:
- housing-example: introduction to machine learning in python using housing data following a step-by-step tutorial from the above mentioned textbook
- matplotlib: introduction to matplotlib library and using modules 
- pandas: introduction to pandas in python 

mpi - learning to write parallel programs in python:
- blur-proj: writing a program that manipulates images. Initially intended for blurring images, now modified for edge recognition. Programs written in both serial and parallel, with variations in order to gain an understanding of the impact of parallelisation. First done using joblib from python, then incorporating mpi4py to run the program on multiple images in parallel 
- general programs: learning basic mpi4py functionality 

slacklogger - writing a slack handler for python logger to post debugging messages to slack channels:
- full code moved to inJeans/LogSlacker repository
