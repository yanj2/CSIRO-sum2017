The following command line options and corresponding MCA parameter have
been deprecated and replaced as follows:

  Command line options:
    Deprecated:  --bynode, -bynode
    Replacement: --map-by node

  Equivalent MCA parameter:
    Deprecated:  rmaps_base_bynode
    Replacement: rmaps_base_mapping_policy=node
